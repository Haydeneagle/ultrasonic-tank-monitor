# Ultrasonic Tank Monitor using ESP32-C3

## Overview

This project is a wireless water tank monitoring solution, based on the ESP32-C3 microcontroller. 

To measure the water level, the AJ-SR04M waterproof ultrasonic sensor is used, measuring the height of the water level. This measured height value combined with the tank diameter and height of the sensor above the full water mark allows for the volume of the tank to be calculated.

Currently, the data is transmitted over Wi-Fi using the MQTT protocol to communicate with a Mosquitto broker linked to Home Assistant, allowing for the data to be easily visualized and used in home automations.
